function fun = DiscreteDelta(mesh, l2ip, elem, ecrd, wts)
% DiscreteDelta - Evaluate sum of discrete delta functions.
%   
%   USAGE:
%
%   fun = DiscreteDelta(mesh, l2ip, elem, ecrd, wts)
%
%   INPUT:
%
%   mesh is a MeshStructure
%   l2ip is n x n, 
%        the inner product matrix for the mesh, where
%        n is the number of independent degrees of freedom
%   elem is an n-vector of integers, 
%        the list of elements containing the delta-function points 
%   ecrd is m x n, 
%        the list of barycentric coordinates of the delta-function points
%   wts  is an n-vector,(optional)
%        it gives the weights of each point; if not present,
%        the weights are set to one
%
%   OUTPUT:
%
%   fun is an n-vector, 
%       the nodal point values of the sum of the discrete
%       delta functions associated with the points and weights
%
%   NOTES:  
%
%   *  The resulting function is not normalized in any way.
